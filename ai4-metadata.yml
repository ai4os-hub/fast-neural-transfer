title: Artistic Style Transfer
summary: A module to apply artistic style transfer using pytorch.
description: '"This is neural_transfer application using DEEPaaS API.\n" "The module allows you to take the content of an image and reproduce it with a new artistic style using the style of a different image." "The code is based on the <a href=https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/fast_neural_style>Faster Neural Style Pytorch example<\/a> " "that implements the method described in " "\"Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution\" developed by Justin Johnson, Alexandre Alahia and Li Fei-Fei [1]." "" "**References**\n" "[1] Justin Johnson, Alexandre Alahi, Li Fei-Fei, Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution, " "<a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08155>arXiv:1603.08155 [cs.CV]<\/a>" ""'
