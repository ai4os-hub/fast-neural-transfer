title: Artistic Style Transfer
summary: A module to apply artistic style transfer using Pytorch.
description: |-
  This is neural_transfer application using DEEPaaS API.
  
  The module allows you to take the content of an image and reproduce it with a new artistic style using the style of a different image.

  The code is based on the [Faster Neural Style Pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/fast_neural_style) example that implements 
  the method described in _Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution_ developed by Justin Johnson, Alexandre Alahia and Li Fei-Fei [1].
